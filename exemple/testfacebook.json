Really quiet at first.  I tend to hate people, until they prove themselves worthy of any other emotion. However, I'm always up for meeting new people..if they don't suck.\r\nI'm really lazy. I like sitting around procrastinating, lollygagging, & stuff like that.\r\n\r\n I will drink socially, but man, I hate the taste of alcohol. I hate cigarettes these days, but I can't bring myself to quit completely. \r\nI'm very much for women's and GLBT rights.\r\nI'm probably bored, and you should probably talk to me.","significant_other_id":"100002337366829","hs_info":{"grad_year":2003,"hs1_name":"Wissahickon Senior High School","hs2_name":""},"family":[{"uid":100003922977280,"relationship":"daughter"},{"uid":100000689452436,"relationship":"cousin"},{"uid":100001651974610,"relationship":"sister"},{"uid":1663123803,"relationship":"brother"},{"uid":31713400,"relationship":"cousin"},{"uid":62700884,"relationship":"sister"},{"uid":609676909,"relationship":"cousin"},{"uid":747054216,"relationship":"cousin"},{"uid":1458000629,"relationship":"sister"}],"current_location":{"country":"United States","city":"Philadelphia","zip":"","name":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","id":101881036520836,"state":"Pennsylvania"},"games":"Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold, Jill of the Jungle, Apogee Software, UNO, Scattergories","pic_with_logo":"http://external.ak.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDnu3uFtZIeJlbM&url=http%3A%2F%2Fprofile.ak.fbcdn.net%2Fhprofile-ak-ash4%2F371498_55400244_1045325057_s.jpg&logo&v=5","status":{"comment_count":0,"time":1350150531,"message":"Have had Ace of Base stuck in head for past 3 days...:/","status_id":669132686125},"affiliations":[{"name":"Arcadia","type":"college","nid":16777771}],"wall_count":"902","activities":"Bike riding, Bacon, Sleep, Cuddling, Laughing, Talking, Reading, Boxing, Food, Lying on the Grass and Staring at the Sky, Smiling, Learning, Stupid Board Games, Sleeping, Feeding Ducks and Geese, Traveling, Singing, Calculating Decay of Radioactive Materials","birthday_date":"02/07/1985","books":"Philip Roth, Paul Feig, Fat Girl by Judith Moore, Augusten Burroughs, David Sedaris, Or Bret Easton Ellis, Jonathan Franzen, Anne Lamott, Jonathan Lethem, Jonathan Safran Foer","pic_big":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash4/371498_55400244_1045325057_n.jpg","last_name":"Gusoff","languages":[{"name":"American English","id":113301478683221},{"name":"French","id":108106272550772}],"tv":"Salute Your Shorts, Investigation Discovery, Breaking Bad, Damages, Melrose Place, Sleeper Cell, Sleeper Cell, Reading Rainbow, Clarissa Explains It All, AMC, My Strange Addiction, Strawberry Shortcake, Dawson's Creek, All That, Ren and Stimpy, Daria, Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Pawn Stars on History, Six Feet Under, Boy Meets World, 48 Hours, Jeopardy!, Sex and the City, Grey's Anatomy, Big Love, Tosh.0, The Nanny, Jack bauer named his cat chuck Norris because it is a pussy, 6abc Action News, Family Guy, Beavis and Butt-Head, The Office, Disappeared, Cash Cab, The L Word, Dr. Phil, The Sopranos, Saved By The Bell, HBO, Law & Order, Seinfeld, Supranos, The Walking Dead, Unsolved Mysteries, The Golden Girls, Mad Men, 24, The Nanny, Quantum Leap, Queer as Folk, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Jersey Shore, Top Chef, Nip/Tuck","pic_small_with_logo":"http://external.ak.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCZQXy-9HiBldxS&url=http%3A%2F%2Fprofile.ak.fbcdn.net%2Fhprofile-ak-ash4%2F371498_55400244_1045325057_t.jpg&logo&v=5","birthday":"February 7, 1985","name_format":"{first} {last}","likes_count":"537","quotes":"\"I don't know what to do with people who don't want to have sex with me.\" --Claire\r\n\r\n\"When I got the music, I got a place to go.\" --Rancid","interests":"People magazine, Epic Games, 1980s, Assateague Island, Cherries, The Stuff Listed in Activities, LGBT, Drag queens, France.fr, Contemporary Fiction","education":[{"school":{"name":"Wissahickon Senior High School","id":110657018955169},"type":"High School","year":{"name":"2003","id":194603703904595}},{"concentration":[{"name":"French","id":110262255662482}],"school":{"name":"Arcadia University","id":19392406949},"type":"College","year":{"name":"2012","id":115222815248992}}],"relationship_status":"In a relationship","notes_count":"12","sex":"female","pic_small":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash4/371498_55400244_1045325057_t.jpg","pic":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash4/371498_55400244_1045325057_s.jpg","hometown_location":{"country":"United States","city":"Blue Bell","zip":"","name":"Blue Bell, Pennsylvania","id":109214592438975,"state":"Pennsylvania"},"profile_url":"http://www.facebook.com/gloria.gusoff","pic_square":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash4/371498_55400244_1045325057_q.jpg","first_name":"Gloria"}
